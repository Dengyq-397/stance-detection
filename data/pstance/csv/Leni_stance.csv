"Let me ask you, pinklawans. How come you went audacious to accuse Isko Moreno, and other men presidentiables of being MISOGYNISTS just because they are against Leni Robredo? Now, can you explain why did you made a threat when Imelda Marcos was about to run for President?",Against
"The aggressive behavior of presidential candidate Leni Robredo's supporters, known as pinklawans, in inciting rage and manipulating people to change their minds reflects poorly on their candidate, who has remained silent and appears unconcerned about the situation.",Against
The next #6YEARS will be best years for the entire Philippines but hell for the elitists/pinklawans. Bongbong would restore the glory days of the country and I look forward to experience a Marcos regime during my prime years,Against

@ivykrabye @hanssolo16 @ligaya2021 @rey_tesoro That’s your analysis? That’s your basis? That’s your science? Omg. So its true. Leni Robredo’s all-natural IDIOTICS are transmissible … kwawang pinklawan fans. You’re doomed.,Against
There is no way Leni Robredo will ever lead the Opposition to a legal political victory. This is likely the reason that the pinklawans (Robredo’s party and the bloc within the Opposition rabidly loyal to the Aquino-Cojuangco feudal clan) are now in bed with the communists.,Against
"To protect your emotional &amp; mental health, don't argue w/ the pinklawan. When any heated conversations arise, don't let them get into your nerve, block/mute them right away. Don't let them pass unto u their spirit of anger, depression &amp; bully. Don't waste your time on them.",Against
@theadtan What  do you expect to pinklawan? Their heart is full of hatred and their brain  like Leni Robredo,Against
if Marcos did not run. LENI will still not be the top choice. not the best choice. Ping Lacson is way way better than her. Not even next best to him. Leni is never a leader material. no single qualification.   alam nyo yan sa heart nyo mga pinklawan.,Against
